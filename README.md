Second time working with OpenCV, and I think I'm getting a little better at this.

This project uses OpenCV and the mediapipe library to detect certain hand gestures to write morse code. 

Moving your thumb closer to your palm is a "."
Moving your thumb and pointer finger together is a "-"
Moving your middle finger closer to your palm signifies the start of a new letter
Moving your middle finger and thumb closer to your palm resets the text.
